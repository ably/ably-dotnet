[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/compare/1.2.1...1.2.2)

The release includes mainly fixes and improvements

**Breaking change**

- Update `ITransport.Send` return type from `void` to `Result` so it can indicate to the library whether the send succeeded or failed immediately.
  It helped improve a race condition where the transport was disconnected but the library had not processed the update yet. Now we handle queuing and resending messages much better. 

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Improve handling of clock skew [\#303](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/303)

**Fixed bugs:**

- Failing internet check [\#437](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/437)

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/tree/1.2.0) (2020-06-08)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/compare/1.1.20...1.2.0)

Adds the capability to subscribe to a channel in delta mode.

Subscribing to a channel in delta mode enables [delta compression](https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/channels/channel-parameters/deltas). This is a way for a client to subscribe to a channel so that message payloads sent contain only the difference (ie the delta) between the present message and the previous message on the channel.
