    /// 1. It serializes requests coming from different threads and guarantees that they are executing one by one and in order
    /// on a single thread. This makes it very easy to mutate state because we are immune from thread race conditions.
    /// There requests are encapsulated in Command objects (objects inheriting from RealtimeCommand) which provide
    /// information about what needs to happen and also hold any parameters necessary for the operation. For example if we take the
    /// SetClosedStateCommand object. The intention is to change the Connection state to Closed but the Command object also contains the error
    /// if any associated with this request. This makes logging very easy as we can clearly see the intent of the command and the parameters. Also in the
    /// future we can parse the logs and easily recreate state in the library.
    /// 2. Centralizes the logic for handling Commands. It is now much easier to find where things are happening. If you exclude
    /// Channel presence and Channel state management, everything else could be found in this class. It does make it rather long but
    /// the logic block are rather small and easy to understand.
