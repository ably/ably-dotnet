## **Setup** 
- After cloning the project, open unity-hub.

![](readme_images/unity_projects.PNG)
- Click on `ADD` button and open project under `ably-dotnet\unity` 
- Default project layout should look as below
  
![](readme_images/unity_default_layout.PNG)  
- In current layout, test runner is missing. Default layout is not so user-friendly, so we need to change it as per requirement.
- Unity custom layout is provided under `ably-dotnet\unity\unity_layout.wlt`
- From the top-right corner, click selector named `Default`, it should show the menu to change the layout.
  
![](readme_images/unity_change_layout.PNG)  
- Select `Load Layout From File` and choose file under `ably-dotnet\unity\unity_layout.wlt`. New layout should look like this.

![](readme_images/unity_custom_layout.PNG)  
- Now we have a test runner windows at bottom-left along with user-friendly editor layout.

### **Disable assembly validation error**
- Unity internally has `NewtonSoftJson` package with assembly naming conflicting with provided `NewtonSoftJson.JSON.dll`(https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity) as a plugin.
- So, it gives assembly validation error in the console while building the project, to resolve issue, disable `Assembly Validation`
- Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Assembly Version Validation`, uncheck the box and click on apply.
