- For more information related to Unity installation, please go through the [official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityOverview.html) for [Installing Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingUnity.html), [Unity Editor tabs/Windows](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html), [Editor features](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditorFeatures.html) and [Visual Studio Unity integration](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VisualStudioIntegration.html).

**3.** **Visual Studio -**
- Visual studio community is free to use so it can be downloaded and installed using ***visual studio installer***.
- Download the official [visual studio installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.
- ***Visual Studio installer*** is used to manage different versions of Visual Studio along with the necessary plugins and individual components for each version of Visual Studio. 
- Install and open the Visual Studio installer.

1. Install Visual Studio
- There are two tabs visible. One shows `Installed` Visual Studio versions and the other `Available` versions.

![](doc_images/visual_studio_installer.PNG)  
- If you have no versions installed, a new window will open showing visual studio components that need to be installed
- Under the 'Desktop and Mobile' header, click on `.NET desktop development` and ensure the checklist on the right nav bar match up to the below image.

![](doc_images/vsi_modify_1.PNG)

![](doc_images/vsi_individual_1.PNG)
- Next, click on 'Game development with Unity' for unity editor scripting support.

![](doc_images/vsi_modify_2.PNG)
- In the `Individual components` tab on the right nav bar select the following components.

![](doc_images/vsi_individual_2.PNG)  
- Finally, click the 'modify' button on the bottom-right to install visual studio with selected components.
- You can follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBo5Cso-ufE for a more detailed guide on setting up Visual Studio for Unity.

2. Update/Repair/Modify installed visual studio
- If you need to change anything with Visual Studio, open the Visual Studio installer, where you should see the Visual Studio versions you have installed.

![](doc_images/visual_studio_installer.PNG)

- Click on `Modify` on the version you wish to change the original component installation as below.

![](doc_images/vsi_modify_1.PNG)
- Check the missing/broken components and click on `Modify` to install them again.

## **Setup** 
- After cloning this project, open the Unity Hub.

![](doc_images/unity_projects.PNG)
- Click on the `ADD` button and open this project under `ably-dotnet\unity`.
- The default project layout should look as below:
  
![](doc_images/unity_default_layout.PNG)  
- The default layout displayed has the test runner missing. For a more optimized layout for development, we have a custom Unity layout found under `ably-dotnet\unity\unity_editor_layout.wlt`.
- To apply our custom layout, you can click the selector named `Default` in the top-right corner.
  
![](doc_images/unity_change_layout.PNG)  
- Select `Load Layout From File` and choose the file `ably-dotnet\unity\unity_editor_layout.wlt`. The new layout should look like this:

![](doc_images/unity_custom_layout.PNG)  
- We now have a test runner window in the bottom-left along with a user-friendly editor layout.

### **Disable assembly validation error**
- Unity has a [`NewtonSoftJson`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.0/manual/index.html) package used by default, which conflicts with the [`NewtonSoftJson.JSON.dll`](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity) included with the Ably plugin, resulting in assembly validation errors. To resolve this, we need to disable `Assembly Validation`.
- Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Assembly Version Validation`, uncheck the box, then click `Apply`.

```
- More information relating to Asset Package Export and Import can be found in https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html.

## **CI/CD for unity**
- Currently, CI/CD for Unity projects are available using [gameCI](https://game.ci/) (open source tool), [codemagic](https://unitycicd.com/) and [unity cloud build](https://unity.com/products/cloud-build).
- To use gameCI, follow the [gameCI GitHub actions documentation](https://game.ci/docs/github/getting-started).
- To use codemagic, follow the [CI for Unity games using codemagic](https://blog.codemagic.io/why-to-use-cicd-for-unity-games/) blog post and [getting started with Unity codemagic documentation](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-quick-start/building-a-unity-app/).
- Learn more about Unity Cloud Build [here](https://unity.com/products/unity-devops/pricing#cloud-build).

## Updating the Ably Unity Package
- Currently, the latest Ably source code is imported as DLLs in Unity using [Unity Plug-ins](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Plugins.html).
- This is done as part of the [release process](../CONTRIBUTING.md/#release-process) by running `./unity-plugins-updater.sh 1.2.3` (linux/mac) / `.\unity-plugins-updater.cmd 1.2.3` (windows) at the root.
- This script is responsible for copying the latest `ably` and `deltacodec` release DLLs into `unity/Assets/Ably/Plugins/`.
- Other DLLs available under `unity/Assets/Ably/Plugins/` are dependencies of `ably` and `deltacodec`. 
- Those plugins need to be updated manually if the copies of  `ably` or `deltacodec` DLLs become incompatible with them.
 i.e. If versions of those dependencies are changed/updated using Nuget Package Manager.
