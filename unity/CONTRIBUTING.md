![](doc_images/vsi_modify_1.PNG)
- Check missing components and click on `Modify` to install them again.

## **Setup** 
- After cloning the project, open unity-hub.

![](doc_images/unity_projects.PNG)
- Click on `ADD` button and open project under `ably-dotnet\unity` 
- Default project layout should look as below
  
![](doc_images/unity_default_layout.PNG)  
- In current layout, test runner is missing. Default layout is not so user-friendly, so we need to change it as per requirement.
- Unity custom layout is provided under `ably-dotnet\unity\unity_editor_layout.wlt`
- From the top-right corner, click selector named `Default`, it should show the menu to change the layout.
  
![](doc_images/unity_change_layout.PNG)  
- Select `Load Layout From File` and choose file under `ably-dotnet\unity\unity_editor_layout.wlt`. New layout should look like this.

![](doc_images/unity_custom_layout.PNG)  
- Now we have a test runner windows at bottom-left along with user-friendly editor layout.

### **Disable assembly validation error**
- Unity internally has [`NewtonSoftJson`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.0/manual/index.html) package with assembly naming conflicting with provided `NewtonSoftJson.JSON.dll` (https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity) as a plugin.
- So, it gives assembly validation error in the console while building the project, to resolve issue, disable `Assembly Validation`
- Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Assembly Version Validation`, uncheck the box and click on apply.

## **CI/CD for unity**
- Currently, CI/CD for unity project is available using [gameCI](https://game.ci/) (open source tool), [codemagic](https://unitycicd.com/) and [unity cloud build](https://unity.com/products/cloud-build).
- To use gameCI, follow [gameCI github actions doc](https://game.ci/docs/github/getting-started).
- To use codemagic, follow [CI for unity games using codemagic](https://blog.codemagic.io/why-to-use-cicd-for-unity-games/) and [getting started with unity codemagic docs](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-quick-start/building-a-unity-app/).
- Learn more about unity cloud build [here](https://unity.com/products/unity-devops/pricing#cloud-build).

## **Updating Ably Unitypackage**
- Currently, latest ably source code is imported as DLLs in unity using [unity plug-ins](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Plugins.html).
- It's done as a part of [release process](../CONTRIBUTING.md/#release-process) by running `./unity-plugins-updater.sh 1.2.3` (linux/mac) / `.\unity-plugins-updater.cmd 1.2.3` (windows) at root.
- This script is responsible for copying latest `ably` and `deltacodec` release DLLs into `unity/Assets/Ably/Plugins/`.
- Other DLLs available under `unity/Assets/Ably/Plugins/` are dependencies of `ably` and `deltacodec`. 
- Those needs to be updated manually if copied `ably` or `deltacodec` DLLs become incompatible with them.
 i.e. If versions of those dependencies are changed/updated using nuget package manager.
