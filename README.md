---

## Installation

The SDK is available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ably.io/). To get started with your project, install the package from the Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI.

Package Manager Console:

```shell
PM> Install-Package ably.io
```

.NET CLI in your project directory:

```shell
dotnet add package ably.io
```

### MAUI configuration

When using Ably in a MAUI project, be aware of potential issues caused by assembly trimming, as `ably-dotnet` relies on the reflection API. 

Add the following to your `.csproj` file to prevent trimming of the `IO.Ably` assembly:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <TrimmerRootAssembly Include="IO.Ably" />
</ItemGroup>
```

---

## Usage

The following code connects to Ably's realtime messaging service, subscribes to a channel to receive messages, and publishes a test message to that same channel:

```csharp
// Initialize Ably Realtime client
var realtime = new AblyRealtime("your-ably-api-key");

// Wait for connection to be established
realtime.Connection.On(ConnectionEvent.Connected, args =>
{
   Console.WriteLine("Connected to Ably");
});

// Get a reference to the 'test' channel
IRealtimeChannel channel = realtime.Channels.Get("test");

// Subscribe to all messages published to this channel
channel.Subscribe(message =>
{
   Console.WriteLine($"Received message: {message.Data}");
});

// Publish a test message to the channel
await channel.PublishAsync("test-event", "Hello World!");
```

### Increasing transport send and receive buffers for .NET framework

In high-throughput scenarios, for example, sending messages >50KB, the default WebSocket buffer in the .NET Framework can cause instability or errors. This issue is discussed in [GitHub issue #446](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/446).

To mitigate this, increase the WebSocket buffer size to the maximum allowed (64KB):

```csharp
var maxBufferSize = 64 * 1024;

var options = new ClientOptions();
var websocketOptions = new MsWebSocketOptions
{
    SendBufferInBytes = maxBufferSize,
    ReceiveBufferInBytes = maxBufferSize
};

options.TransportFactory = new MsWebSocketTransport.TransportFactory(websocketOptions);

var realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
```
